# Technical Decisions

## Enhancements for a Production Environment

As I reflect on the development process and consider the scope of this technical test, several improvements come to mind that would enhance the robustness and scalability of the project in a real production service environment. While these enhancements were not implemented within the timeframe of this test, they are worth considering:

### 1. Implementation of an Event Bus
Integrating an event bus architecture would allow for efficient communication between various components of the system. Events could be recorded for relevant domain actions and published by the application service responsible for managing the aggregate root. This approach promotes loose coupling and enhances scalability.

### 2. Evaluation of CQRS Pattern
Considering the complexity and requirements of the project, evaluating the necessity of incorporating the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern would be prudent. This pattern separates read and write operations, potentially improving performance and scalability. Implementing a command bus and a query bus could further streamline the execution of commands and queries.

### 3. Unit Testing
Each domain and application class containing logic would benefit from having its own suite of unit tests.

### 4. Acceptance Tests
Implementing acceptance tests for every application flow.

### 5. Separation of Databases
Maintaining separate databases for production and testing purposes is essential for data integrity and reliability. By isolating test data from production data, potential conflicts and unintended side effects can be mitigated effectively.

### 6. Integration of Linter (e.g., ESLint)
Incorporating a linter such as ESLint ensures code consistency and adherence to coding standards across the codebase.

### 7. Implementation of CI/CD Pipeline
Setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions automates the process of running tests and performing static analysis. This ensures that code changes are thoroughly validated before being deployed to production, enhancing overall code quality and reliability.
